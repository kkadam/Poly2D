Poly2D (branch bipoly)
======================
//Kundan Kadam July 16 2014

Purpose:
1. Creates a 2d rotating bipolytropic star or torus. This means that the star can have 
   a core and envelope with different polytropic indices and there can be a molecular 
   weight jump between the core-envelope boundary.
   
Required:
1. Guesses for points A, B and C.
   A(ax.ay) = equatorial boundary of rotating star/ outer edge of torus torus
   B(bx,by) = axial boundary of rotating star/ inner edge of torus torus
   C(ix, 2) = inner/ outer boundary of the core
   Specified in file runhydro.h.
   
How to use:
1. Specify relevant parameters in file runhydro.h
2. Do:
   >> make cl
   >> make
   >> ./scf
   
Note:
Passed all tests. Lost records of tests.
